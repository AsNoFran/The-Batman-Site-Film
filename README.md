# The Batman - Test admission School

Here is a project I made for my admission test to a coding school.
This site was created by myself from my own knowledge.

The languages ​​I used are HTML, CSS and some JS.

On the last "series.html" page, you will see an image representing the batsignal.
Clicking on the JS code will make the image grow and shrink.

Thanks for watching.
